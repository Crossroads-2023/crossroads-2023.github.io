_A challenge to intuition_

During this talk we will consider different problems or situations in which, for some reason, the 
answer goes against our intuition. In some cases this will be related to becoming familiar with
a very fast type of growth, which allows us, for example, not to become victims of scams. Another
concept that challenges our intuition is infinity, where there is so much space that we will be able 
to find the 2026 World Cup song, that they haven't invented yet!
