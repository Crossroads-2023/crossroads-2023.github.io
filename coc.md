### Code of conduct 

As organisers we are committed to creating an atmosphere of respect, 
professionalism and consideration among all participants of this event, in 
particular during talks, discussions and informal conversation. We believe 
this event must be supportive, inclusive, and a safe environment for all 
participants, independent of any aspect of their identity. 

We are committed to ensuring that the scientific events in which we 
participate follow these principles. In most situations, simple common 
sense and good judgment should suffice as guidance, but we appreciate that 
some questions of appropriate behavior can be more complex and subtle. We 
encourage participants to be supportive of one another, and to act and 
interact with their fellow attendees in a way that is genuinely respectful 
and considerate.  
 
Discrimination and harassment are unacceptable in all our spaces and will 
not be tolerated. If you think you have experienced or witnessed such 
behavior or if you do not feel comfortable with the way you are being 
treated, we urge you to contact any member of the [organising committee](https://crossroads-2023.github.io/organization.html).
