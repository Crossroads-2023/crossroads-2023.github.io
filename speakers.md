### Lecturers

1. [Federico Ardila](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/) (San Francisco State Universty and Universidad de los Andes)

_Matroids, combinatorics, and geometry._ In recent years, the geometric roots of matroid theory have grown much deeper, bearing many new fruits. This lecture series will survey some recent successes. We will discuss three geometric models of matroids at the intersection of combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. Each has led to the development of intriguing combinatorics and to the solution of long-standing conjectures on graph and matroid inequalities.

2. [Karin Baur](https://imsc.uni-graz.at/baur/) (Universität Graz)

_Cluster algebras and cluster categories via surfaces._ Twenty years of research in cluster theory have established deep links between cluster algebras, surface geometry and representation theory. Cluster structures can be defined using surface geometry, with curves corresponding to cluster variables and to rigid objects in associated categories. The classical Ptolemy relations give rise to exchange phenomena or mutation in the associated cluster structures. In these lectures I will focus on the geometric approach to cluster algebras and cluster categories. Topics discussed will include cluster structures on the Grassmannian, friezes, laminations, Postnikov diagrams, dimer models, root combinatorics.

3. [Najib Idrissi](https://idrissi.eu) (Universite de Paris)

_Configurations spaces, algebraic topology and operads._ 
I plan to explain how two classical objects in algebraic topology are related: configuration spaces, and operads. Configuration spaces, on the one hand, consist in collections of pairwise distinct points in a given manifold. The study of these spaces is a classical problem in algebraic topology. Operads, on the other hand, are algebraic objects whose representations are categories of algebras (e.g., associative algebras, commutative algebras, or Lie algebras). The intimate relationship between these two objects comes in the form of the little disks operads, a certain family of operads which is central in many applications and which involves the configuration spaces of the Euclidean spaces. I will show how ideas that come from the theory of operads --- namely, the proof of the formality of the little disks operads --- is useful in order to settle the question of the rational homotopy invariance of configuration spaces.

4. [David Jordan](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~djordan/) (University of Edinburgh)

_An introduction to geometric representation theory for quantum groups._
One of the most important developments in representation theory of algebraic groups and Lie algebras in the last 30 years was the introduction of methods from algebraic geometry.  By studying line bundles, differential operators, orbits, slices and other geometric constructions on spaces with group actions, such as flag varieties G/B, or coadjoint quotients g/G, we obtain deep insight into the representation theory of these structures.  More recently, starting with works of Tanisaki, Backelin--Kremnitzer, Arkhipov--Gaitsgory, Varangolo--Vasserot a program of geometric representation theory for quantum groups was founded.  I will survey these works and then outline some more recent developments.

5. [Victoria Lebed](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/) (Université de Caen)

_Origamics: the Mathematics of Origami_. Origami is a natural tool for making geometry classes fun and memorable. We will discover and refresh on some mathematical concepts and theorems while folding and unfolding napkins, in the same exact way as it was done in some 1930s Japanese schools!

On the other hand, origami is a fascinating object of mathematical research. Thus, we will learn how to divide any angle into three equal parts by paper folding (which is impossible using the traditional 
ruler and compass!). Next, armed with some more square pieces of paper, we will attack the _Bigger Dollar Problem_, suggested by 19 year old 
Vladimir Arnold, who would later become one of the most eminent 20th century mathematicians.

6. [Nicolás Libedinsky](https://nicolaslibedinsky.cl) (Universidad de Chile)

_Representation theory and categorification._ In the past ten years some spectacular developments in representation theory (of objects like the symmetric group or SL(n)) has arisen. Many things were known in characteristic zero and it was conjectured that in positive characteristic things were controlled by the same kind of objects. But this set of conjectures are now known to be false, and the new understanding of modular representation theory is much richer, deeper, and surprising (although we only know the very tip of the iceberg). For example, there is some fractal behaviour, there are some "dynamical systems" phenomena, strange number-theoretical phenomena and emerging connections with physics, homotopy of spheres and other "distant" parts of mathematics. It is a fascinating and expanding field that we will explore in this course.

7. [Sarah Scherotzke](https://wwwde.uni.lu/research/fstm/dmath/people/sarah_scherotzke) (Université du Luxembourg)

First, we give an introduction to the notion of moduli stack of a differential graded category. Then we explain what shifted symplectic structures are and how they are connected to Calabi--Yau structures on dg categories. More concretely, we will show that the cotangent complex to the  moduli stack of a differential graded category A is isomorphic to the moduli stack of the "Calabi--Yau completion" of A, answering a conjecture of Keller--Yeung. This is joint work with Damien Calaque and Tristan Bozec, see [arxiv.org/abs/2006.01069](arxiv.org/abs/2006.01069)

8. [Catharina Stroppel](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/stroppel/) (Universität Bonn). _To be confirmed_.

9. [Leandro Vendramin](https://vendramin.github.io) (Vrije Universiteit Brussel)

_Computational algebra: groups, rings and combinatorics_. We present the computer algebra system GAP and use it to solve some research-level problems in algebra and combinatorics. The topics to investigate are groups, certain finite rings and some combinatorial structures associated with the Yang-Baxter equation (with applications in knot theory).  GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with emphasis on computational group theory. Lecture notes available [here](https://github.com/vendramin/gap). This mini-course will be delivered together with Victoria Lebed.
