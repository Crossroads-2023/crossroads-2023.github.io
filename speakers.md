            <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtkb/">Karin Baur </a> is a professor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds. After obtaining her PhD in 2002 from the University of Basel in Switzerland she spent her post-doctoral years at ETH, at UCSD and at the University of Leicester before being an SNSF professor at ETH. She became a full professor at the University of Graz in 2011. Her research interests lie in algebraic, combinatorial and geometric methods in representation theory. <em>Photo by Severin Nowacki</em>.

            <a href="https://idrissi.eu/">Najib Idrissi</a> is a maître de conférences at Université Paris Cité since 2018. He obtained his PhD in mathematics from the Université de Lille in 2017 under the direction of Benoit Fresse and worked as a postdoc at ETH Zurich in 2018 under Thomas Willwacher. He is mainly interested in operads, whether algebraic or topological, and their applications to the computation of invariants of manifolds and their configuration spaces through the theory of graph complexes. In 2020, he was awarded the Peccot <a href="https://idrissi.eu/research/peccot">Lecture</a> and <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/cours-peccot/guestlecturer-2020-03-04-11h00.htm">Prize</a> by the Collège de France and lectured on the real homotopy type of configuration spaces.

            is a Reader in the Hodge Institute at the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics.  He received his PhD from MIT in 2011, followed by an NSF postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Texas before joining the University of Edinburgh as a Chancellor’s fellow in 2013.  In 2015 he was awarded an ERC Starting Grant to study the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/637618">quantum geometric Langlands topological field theory</a>.  His work centers on quantum topology of 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional manifolds, combining tools from higher algebra, representation theory of quantum groups, and elements of skein theory.  With his collaborators he has developed the mathematical foundation for the Betti quantum geometric Langlands TFT, a model for the Kapustin–Witten twist of N=4 SUSY Yang–Mills gauge theory.
