### Registration

The application process to the school is now open. Deadline for applications (with or without funding) is November 30th 2022. Priority will be given to applications submitted before this deadline.

1. Please register using the form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR5r20V8rkBqHPn-UCq84lHLKLs95B_ectIom3mQth-QqxaQ/viewform), and read below for details on funding support. 

2.  Applicants must send an email to [arg23.math@hu-berlin.de](arg23.math@hu-berlin.de) with a short curriculum vitae. The subject of the email should be “CV NAME SURNAME”.

3. Applicants must arrange for recommendation letters to be sent to the same email. The subject of the email should be “Reference letter - NAME SURNAME OF APPLICANT - NAME SURNAME OF REFEREE”). Note that:

  - if you are a master student, two recommendation letters are required,
  - if you are a PhD student, one (but preferably two) recommendation letters are required,
  - if you are a postdoc, one recommendation letter is required.

**CIMPA Funding**: applicants from developing countries (according to the CIMPA criteria) can apply for CIMPA funding (for precise criteria of eligibility, see the CIMPA website). In this situation,  you have to register on the link at the bottom of [https://www.cimpa.info/fr/node/7223](https://www.cimpa.info/fr/node/7223). 

*Important!* Among other information, you need to provide the name of at least one (preferably two) scholars who can recommend your CIMPA application. Thus, you do not need to send recommendation letters to [arg23.math@hu-berlin.de](arg23.math@hu-berlin.de) if you are applying for CIMPA funding.

**Other funding**: we have limited funding available. Priority will be given to participants in the early stages of their career, and participants from developing countries who do not have access to a grant. The travel and accommodation costs we ask you about refer to this alternative funding, and not to CIMPA funding.
