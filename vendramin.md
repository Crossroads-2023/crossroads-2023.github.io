_Computational algebra: groups, rings and combinatorics_. We present the computer algebra system GAP and use it to solve some research-level problems in algebra and combinatorics. The topics to investigate are groups, certain finite rings and some combinatorial structures associated with the Yang-Baxter equation (with applications in knot theory).  GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with emphasis on computational group theory. 


### Installing GAP ###

We strongly recommend that all participants have either SAGE or GAP installed _before_ 
the lectures begin. To install SAGE, which comes with a GAP distribution,
please see [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). To install GAP, 
there are general instructions available [here](https://www.gap-system.org/Download/index.html). 
If you would prefer not to install GAP, you can find an online alternative 
[here](https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter).
