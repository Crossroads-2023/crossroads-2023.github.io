_Computational algebra: groups, rings and combinatorics_. We present the computer algebra system GAP and use it to solve some research-level problems in algebra and combinatorics. The topics to investigate are groups, certain finite rings and some combinatorial structures associated with the Yang-Baxter equation (with applications in knot theory).  GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with emphasis on computational group theory. 


### Assistants ###

[_Arne van Antwerpen_](https://vanantwerpen.github.io/) was the assistant to Leandro Vendramin for this course's tutorials.

Arne is a postdoc at Vrije Universiteit  Brussel (VUB) in Brussels, Belgium. He completed his PhD in 2020 at Vrije Universiteit Brussel under the supervision of Eric Jespers. His research interests include set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, skew braces, finite group theory and finiteness conditions in ring theory.

### Installing GAP ###

We strongly recommend that all participants have either SAGE or GAP installed _before_ 
the lectures begin. To install SAGE, which comes with a GAP distribution,
please see [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html). To install GAP, 
there are general instructions available [here](https://www.gap-system.org/Download/index.html). 
If you would prefer not to install GAP, you can find an online alternative 
[here](https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter).
